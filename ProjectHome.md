# Overview #

[TestManager](TestManagerOverview.md) is a supporting tool for test management in terms of easy overview of multiple test execution and execution trends. Helps testers to evaluate test results much faster and report issues quickly.

A centralized collection of test results makes it possible to see all your results in one place. Quickly access your older results and have a common knowledge database about your failed tests, bugs and test script errors.

The common knowledge base helps you analyse your current test results based on your previous experiences. The error database is shared across all results, so all co-workers help each other in the process making bug finding a lot faster.

Trends are also available and are instantly generated while your tests are running. Pie charts, line charts are there for you to help you visualize your current state of testing.
